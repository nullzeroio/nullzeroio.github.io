      <description>As part of a new initiative, of sorts, I wanted a way to record daily accomplishments, which is something that I have thought about doing for quite some time, but never got enough motivation to actually do anything about it. That said, I decided to revisit, take action and come up with some requirements on what a workable solution would look like (for me):
 It needs to be easy to record entries (if it&amp;rsquo;s hard or cumbersome, it won&amp;rsquo;t have sustainability) It needs to fit into my daily workflow The format needs to be somewhat open/easy to move between different platforms (Mainly Windows &amp;amp; Mac OS) If possible, pick a solution that can sharpen a skill-set, in the process  Given each of those, my final solution ended up being quite simple: GitHub and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) files.</description>
